Title: Multivariate Data Analysis for Grizzly Bears, Italian Wines, and Housing Satisfaction

Description:
This project involves an in-depth analysis of three diverse datasets: measurements of Alaskan grizzly bears, chemical properties of Italian wines, and housing satisfaction responses. The primary objective is to apply advanced statistical methods to gain insights and make informed decisions.

Grizzly Bear Analysis:

Data: Measurements of 61 grizzly bears.
Goal: Ensure a healthy bear population.
Tasks: Data exploration, covariance matrix verification, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), interpretation of the first principal component, identifying influential variables.
Italian Wine Analysis:

Data: Chemical concentrations in wines.
Goal: Summarize six key variables.
Tasks: Data preparation, outlier detection, PCA with justification for retained components, interpretation of the second largest eigenvalue.
Housing Satisfaction Analysis:

Data: Responses to a satisfaction questionnaire.
Goal: Uncover underlying dimensions and enable future measurements.
Tasks: Variable selection, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) vs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) justification, validation, assessing simple structure, rotation impact, recommendations, justifying EFA over PCA.
This project showcases proficiency in data analysis using advanced statistical techniques. The insights gained will inform decision-making in bear population management, wine quality assessment, and understanding housing satisfaction.
